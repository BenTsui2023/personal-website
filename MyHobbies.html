						<h2>My First Hobby</h2>
						<p>
							Apart from working and learning, I love cat and <mark>look after my cat</mark> is one of my favourite hobby. I have a pet called cookie and i treat her as a family member. I feed her twice a day and play with her together.
							For example, she like to play ball and chase the laser lights moving from my penlight. She is independant and always curious to everything.
							So, it is easy for me to interact with her and have the fun. It is comforting and healing when i hug and touch her.
						</p>					
						<p>
							Besides, i like to <mark>feed stray cat</mark> when i hang out on the street. Although not all stray cats come to me and accept my help easily and sometimes they may lash out and scratch me, i still try to find the right way to appoach and help them.
