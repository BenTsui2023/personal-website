						<h2>The Place I Choose to Live</h2>
						<p>
							Living in Canada for three months, I find that Canada is a multicultural society and has a friendly environment. Overall, Canada is a comfortable place to live.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, all my friends and family members live in Hong Kong and I love them. Also, the Hong Kong government has a blueprint to encourage the innovation and technology industry to develop Hong Kong into a smart city. The start-up company in Hong Kong is thriving and the employers could offer high wages to hire and retain skilled IT professionals.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, Hong Kong is my ideal place to start my IT career. I believe that having learning experience in Canada makes me easier to get a desirable job in Hong Kong. Therefore, I will take care of my family members and look for job opportunities to develop my IT career in my hometown after graduating from Douglas College.
